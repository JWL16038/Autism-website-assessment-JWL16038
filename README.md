# Autism website project

## About
This web app was made using Python and Flask for my Year 13 Digital Technologies NCEA assessment in 2020. The purpose of this web app was to make the lives of  people with autism or with a disability easier by matching them to available caregivers.

## Outcomes
From this project, I learnt how to make a full-stack web application using Python, Flask and SQL. This project also taught me the importance of debugging and testing my application to mitigate any known bugs in my web app.
